# DistributedMovieTicketBookingManagementSystem

Designed and implemented a fault-tolerant, distributed system for movie ticket booking using web services and UDP communication. 
The system features three server replicas (ATWATER, VERDUN, OUTREMONT) to ensure high availability and software failure tolerance. 
Key functionalities include ticket booking, cancellation, ticket exchange, and real-time movie slot management. 
The architecture integrates a Front End module for client interaction, a Sequencer for request ordering, and Replica Managers for fault detection and recovery. 
Implemented concepts like total ordering, UDP reliability, and high availability to ensure consistent and reliable system performance. 
Developed using Java, Concurrent HashMaps for database management, and tested with comprehensive test cases for admin and customer operations.
This project demonstrates expertise in distributed systems, fault tolerance, and real-time system design.
